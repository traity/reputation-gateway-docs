Reputation Gateway
==================

Traity's social credit score is more human, and outperforms traditional scores for different risks and perils.

Traditional credit scores don't apply to everyone, especially migrants, students or freelancers.
Give a fairer treatment to the great customers of the future with an alternative credit scoring approach,
specially suited for fintechs, startups, insurers and banks.

Integration of Reputation Gateway is very flexible.
You can add it in any part of your applicationâ€™s flow that better adapts to your needs.
Users will be redirected to our site so they can start building their TrustScore and once they finish, they will go back to your site to complete the process in your platform.
At that point, you will be able to read their TrustScore to take more and better informed decisions.
