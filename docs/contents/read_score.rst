Reading the TrustScore
==========================

When users finish the process in Traity, they will redirected to the url you specified in the ``callback_url``
parameter during the widget session’s link initialization. A GET request will be made to that url
and it will include a parameter called ``permission`` that will be needed to read user’s TraityScore from your site. \
That parameter is a JWT token that can be verified it was generated by Traity by using our public key which is:


``<TRAITY-PUBLIC-KEY>``


Now, in order to read the users' score, the only thing that needs to be done, is to sign the ``hash`` claim from this decoded token
with you private key and generate a new one that includes that signature.
Use this new JWT token as an authorization header to make a `GET` request to one of the following URLs:

==========================  =======================
==========================  =======================
 https://rg.traity.com      Live environment
 https://rg-dev.traity.com  Development environment
==========================  =======================

.. tabs::
  .. tab:: Ruby

    .. literalinclude:: ../snippets/read_score.rb
      :language: ruby




That request will return a JSON document similar to this:

.. literalinclude:: ../snippets/score.json

.. warning::
  User's permission will last 24 hours starting at the moment the process of building the TrustScore is completed.
  An error will be raised if score is tried to be accessed with the same token after that period of time.

.. seealso::
  Reputation Gateway is based on `REY <https://reputation.network>`_, the decentralized risk scoring protocol.
  More information about the permission JWT token and its different claims

Interpreting the TrustScore
---------------------------

| The returned response for a score will have two fields.
 `score` which is the global value to indicate the user's trustworthiness,
 and `breakdown`, which includes the different components of the global score which are **identity**, **behavioural_reputation** and **network**.
| Each score will go from 0 to 100.

| **identity** tells how close are the users of being who they say they are, preventing the use of stolen or very recent accounts.


| **behavioural_reputation** tells about users' reputation in sites such as Airbnb or Ebay.
| Having a record of positive transactions in other sites is a good indicator of how will this person behave in a new site with no previous history.

| **network** gives a sense of how trustworthy users' connections are.
| Having a network of trustworthy people is an indicator of accountability.

| You are free to define what you consider a good score to your business or if you want to use any of the breakdown scores.
| From our experience, a TrustScore of at least 70 points is a good starting point to differentiate the most trustworthy users.
| Bear in mind that having a low TrustScore doesn't necessary mean the user can't be trusted. It usually means not enough information
  was provided to make an assesment.
